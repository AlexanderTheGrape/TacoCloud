The home() method is as simple as controller methods come. Itâ€™s annotated with
@GetMapping to indicate that if an HTTP GET request is received for the root path /,
then this method should handle that request. It does so by doing nothing more than
returning a String value of home.
This value is interpreted as the logical name of a view. How that view is implemented
depends on a few factors, but because Thymeleaf is in your classpath, you can
define that template with Thymeleaf.
